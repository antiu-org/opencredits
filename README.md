## How OpenCredits Works

OpenCredits connects to OpenRouter's official API endpoints to provide accurate credit monitoring:

- **Primary**: Uses `/api/v1/credits` endpoint to calculate remaining balance as `total_credits - total_usage`
- **Fallback**: Uses `/api/v1/auth/key` for validation when credits endpoint is unavailable
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects Pay-As-You-Go accounts and displays appropriate status

## Security

- API keys are stored securely using VS Code's SecretStorage
- Keys are never logged or transmitted except to official OpenRouter APIs
- All API requests use HTTPS with proper authentication headers
- No sensitive information is included in error messages or logs

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.74.0 or higher
- Internet connection for API calls
- Valid OpenRouter API key

## Troubleshooting

### Credits Not Showing
1. Ensure OpenRouter is enabled in settings
2. Verify your API key is correct
3. Check your internet connection
4. Use "Refresh Credits" command

### Error States
- **Network Error**: Check internet connection
- **Invalid API Key**: Verify key in configuration
- **Rate Limited**: Wait and try again later

## FAQ - OpenRouter Credit Monitoring

### How often does OpenCredits check my OpenRouter balance?
By default, OpenCredits checks your OpenRouter credits every 5 minutes. You can configure this interval from 1 minute to 24 hours in the extension settings.

### Does OpenCredits work with OpenRouter pay-as-you-go accounts?
Yes! OpenCredits automatically detects pay-as-you-go accounts and displays "PAYG" in the status bar when no prepaid credits are available.

### Is my OpenRouter API key secure?
Absolutely. OpenCredits stores your API key using VS Code's built-in SecretStorage, which is encrypted and secure. Your key is never logged or transmitted anywhere except to official OpenRouter endpoints.

### Can I use OpenCredits with multiple OpenRouter accounts?
Currently, OpenCredits supports one OpenRouter API key per VS Code workspace. Multi-account support may be added in future versions.

### Why should I use OpenCredits instead of checking the OpenRouter dashboard?
OpenCredits saves you time by displaying your credit balance directly in VS Code without interrupting your development workflow. You'll never accidentally run out of credits mid-project again.
